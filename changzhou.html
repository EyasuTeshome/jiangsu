                <h1> Tianning Temple </h1>
                <p>
                    The Tianning Temple, located in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China, is noted for its giant pagoda, the Tianning Pagoda. 
                    Construction began in April 2002 with the opening ceremony for the completed structure held on April 30, 2007, where a crowd of 
                    hundreds of Buddhist monks gathered for the ceremony. With 13 stories and a height of 153.79 meters (505 ft), this is now 
                    the tallest pagoda in the world, taller than China's tallest existent pre-modern Buddhist pagoda, the Liaodi Pagoda built in 
                    1055 at a height of 84 m (275 ft). Although the existing pagoda was built by April 2007, the temple grounds and the pagoda 
                    have a history of construction and destruction for the past 1,350 years, since the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907). 
                    Building of the pagoda was proposed by the Buddhist Association of China in 2001, yet providing money donations for the 
                    temple was an international effort, as leaders of 108 Buddhist associations and temples worldwide attended the opening 
                    ceremony at the temple. On the completion of the new pagoda at Tianning Temple, the mayor of Changzhou, Wang Weicheng, 
                    explicitly correlated his city's economic development with that of religious development in China.
