                    This is the burial place of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Warlord Era. It is located at Purple Mountain in the east suburb of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, covering an area of 80, 000 square meters. It is considered the holy land of Chinese people
                    locally and abroad. Dr. Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925) was a great revolutionary that led the Chinese people to overthrow the corrupt rule of Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and ended 2000 years of the feudal monarchy system, bringing China into
                    a new age. The mausoleum is a must see when you are in Nanjing because of its great historical significance, grand architecture, and beautiful scenery.

                <p>
                    The City Wall of Nanjing was designed by the Hongwu Emperor (1328–1398) after he founded the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) and established Nanjing as the capital in 1368. In order to consolidate his sovereignty and defend the city against coastal pirates,
                    he adopted the suggestions of advisor Zhu Sheng to build a higher city wall, to collect grains and to postpone the coronation. The construction of the wall required the labor of 200,000 workers over twenty-one years to complete. Around
                    7 million cubic metres of earth were shifted. The City Wall of Nanjing was among the largest city walls ever constructed in China. The enclosed Nanjing City is about 55 square kilometers. Another great place to visit when you are in
                    Nanjing.
