                    Langshan Scenic Area is a popular attraction near Nantong City which is located nearby the Yangtze river. It consists of other five hills which are surrounded by water. Langshan consists of five peaks known as Five Hills, all stretched out along the east
                    bank of the Yangtze River Langshan (Wolf Hill), Huangnishan (Yellow Hill), Jianshan (Sword Hill), Junshan (Military Hill), and Ma'anshan (Saddle Hill). The famous most splendid hill among the five hills is langshan. The Wolf Hill is
                    also famous as Buddhist hill which has plenty of buddhist activities. Langshan was the ancient Pagoda was built during Yang dynasty when Buddhism flourished in China around year 669. May not be as magnificent as some other famous Buddhist
                    temples but the view from the top is mind boggling. Yangtze river view, City view or the park surrounding the hill all are worth the small climb.
