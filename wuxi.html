                    This place is adjacent to Lake Tai. The site is a film and television lot built by CCTV to shoot the 84-episoe TV drama “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.” The lot was built to take advantage of the lake scenery. Sets include the naval battle involving
                    the use of fire ships during the Battle of Red Cliffs and the Wu Imperial Palace. Visitors can watch the sets of movies and TV dramas firsthand, they can take photos on the set of “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” and they can whet
                    their appetites watching a performance of “Three Heroes Combating Lu Bu.”

                    It is located on Xiaoling Mountain on the edge of Taihu Lake in Wuxi. Its scale is grand and spectacular. Many great masters came to hold grand ceremonies during its opening, and thus Chinese locals believe that it will bring good fortune if one prays
                    to the great Buddha. There is also an interesting thing to try out when visiting the Buddha. When you look up at the Buddha and walk left or right, regardless of where you go, the eyes of the Buddha are always watching you, as if “the
                    Dharma is boundless and sees everything.

                <p>
                    Taihu, also known as Lake Tai or Lake Taihu, is a lake in the Yangtze Delta and one of the largest freshwater lakes in China. The lake lies in Jiangsu province and significant part of its southern shore forms its border with Zhejiang. With an area of
                    2,250 square kilometers (869 sq mi) and an average depth of 2 meters (6.6 ft), it is the third-largest freshwater lake entirely in China, after Poyang and Dongting. The lake holds about 90 islands, ranging in size from a few square
                    meters to several square kilometers. Lake Tai is linked to the renowned Grand Canal and is the origin of a number of rivers, including Suzhou Creek. In recent years, Lake Tai has been plagued by pollution as the surrounding region
                    experienced rapid industrial development.

                <p>
                    Yuantouzhu is a peninsula which lies on the northwestern shore of Lake Tai, near Wuxi in China's Jiangsu province. It was established as a park in 1916 and celebrated its centennial in 2016. Yuantouzhu, or "Turtle Head Isle" in English (so called because
                    its shape resembles a turtle's head), is a popular scenic tourist region. Tourist ferries leave from Yuantouzhu to the Sanshan Islands, which were opened to tourists in the mid-1980s. Seagulls follow the boat and like to be fed by
                    tourists on boat. The Yuantouzhu park is famous for its tourism especially during the spring season from March to April when hundreds of cherry blossom trees start to bloom. Two gates are open for tourists which are Chongshan gate
                    and Dushan main gate. During the season, there are also at least eight ancient fishing sailboats in the lake.
